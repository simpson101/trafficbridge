November is World Vegan Month, and with a growing number of places appealing to all types of vegans, there's plenty to celebrate. (And maybe not much to make fun of: The editor of a British food magazine recently lost his job over an email ridiculing vegans).</p>

<p>According to a report published by Global Data, the proportion of vegans in the United States has risen from 1 percent over the past three years to 6 percent, and Pinterest says the search for vegan food guides has increased by nearly 200 percent since last year. Whether it's health, religion or the environment, one thing is certain: the vegan community is growing and companies are responding to their needs.</p>

<h2>Take a trip with vegan food, or study with a travel guide</h2>
<p>Adventure outfitter Intrepid Travel has recently launched three new vegan-food tours to India, Italy and Thailand, led by local guides. "The choice of food should not stop anyone from exploring the world," said Neil Coletta, the company's head of food tours. "We make sure that every meal is strictly vegan so that travellers can relax and enjoy". Another travel company, VegVoyages, offers vegan adventures off the beaten track in Bali, Nepal and Southeast Asia, while Vegan Travel takes guests on all-vegan cruises in the Baltic Sea, the Mekong Delta and Patagonia</p>
